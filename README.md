# ehsaas-companion-chatbot-

I’m building this bot because I’ve seen how common overthinking, loneliness, and depression have become among young people, including students. Many of us hesitate to open up, and even when we do, it’s not always easy to find someone who listens without judgment.

I want to create an AI-powered companion that feels more empathetic, human-like, and supportive—a bot that doesn’t just give answers but also provides comfort, presence, and understanding.

To start, I built a proof of concept using the Gemma 3n:e2b model for the backend and Streamlit for the frontend. That served as the initial demo.

Now, I’m moving towards the MVP, where I’ll integrate voice-based and face-based interactions, making the experience more natural and engaging.

My aim is to design a tool that goes beyond chat—something that can genuinely help youth.
